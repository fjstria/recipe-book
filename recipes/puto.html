    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Puto is a beloved steamed rice cake that holds a special place 
      in the culinary traditions of the Philippines. These soft, 
      fluffy cakes are made from a simple mixture of rice flour, 
      coconut milk, sugar, and a leavening agent, resulting in a 
      delicate and slightly sweet flavor. Often enjoyed as a snack or 
      as an accompaniment to savory dishes like dinuguan (pork blood 
      stew) or pancit (noodle dishes), puto is incredibly versatile. 
      It can be found in various flavors and colors, sometimes topped 
      with a slice of cheese or salted egg for an added touch of 
      richness and saltiness. Whether served at festive gatherings 
      or enjoyed as a comforting everyday treat, puto offers a 
      delightful blend of texture and taste that captures the essence 
      of Filipino home cooking.
