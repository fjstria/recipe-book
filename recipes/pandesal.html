    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pandesal is a quintessential Filipino bread roll, cherished 
      for its soft, fluffy texture and slightly sweet flavor. 
      Traditionally enjoyed at breakfast or as a snack, pandesal is 
      made from simple ingredients: flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and 
      water. The dough is rolled in breadcrumbs before baking, giving 
      it a distinctive, lightly crisp crust that contrasts 
      beautifully with its tender interior. Often served warm, 
      pandesal pairs perfectly with butter, cheese, jam, or even 
      savory fillings like ham and eggs. Its comforting taste and 
      versatility make pandesal a staple in Filipino households, 
      evoking a sense of warmth and nostalgia with every bite. 
      Whether enjoyed on its own or as a complement to various 
      dishes, pandesal remains a beloved part of the Philippines' 
      rich culinary heritage.
